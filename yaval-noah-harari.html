                    لـم يخطـئ قدمـاء الفلاسـفة فـي مسـألة خطئهـم فـي معنـى الحريـة الإنسـانية؛ و ذلـك
    أنهـم كانـوا يعتقـدون أن الله خلـق النـاس علـى قسـمين: قسـم ميـزه بالحريـة، و القسـم
    الآخـر قضـى عليـه بالـرق.
    و كانت معيشة الأحرار بعيدة عن الاستقلال، و متأثرة بسلطة رؤساء العائلات و رؤساء
    الحكومة.
    و التاريـخ يحدثنـا بـأن الحكومـة فـي تلـك الأعصـر الخاليـة كانـت تتداخـل فـي كل مـا
    يتعلـق بالحيـاة الخاصـة، و كان لهـا الشـأن الأول فـي نظـام العائلـة، و التربيـة، و الديانـة، و
    الأخـلاق و العواطـف؛ حتـى إنهـا كانـت تحـدد فـي المعامـلات التجاريـة أثمـان البضائـع، و
    قـد وصلـت بهـا الأثـرة بالتداخـل فـي شـئون الحيـاة الخاصـة، إلـى حـد أن قوانيـن اليونـان
    القديمـة كانـت تحجـر علـى النسـاء الخـروج مـن منازلهـن إلا فـي أحـوال مبينـة، فكانـت
    المعيشـة الاجتماعيـة هـي أشـبه شـيء بالعيشـة العسـكرية، يأمـر الحاكـم حينمـا يريـد بمـا
    يريـد، و مـا علـى المحكوميـن إلا أن يطيعـوا أوامـره.
    و لما تقدم العالم في المدنية، تخلص الفرد شـيئا فشـ ًيئا من سـلطة الهيئة الاجتماعية، و
    وسـع في دائرة حريته. و انعكس الأمر، فما كان في السـابق أصـلا عامـا، أصبـح الآن مـن
    المسـتثنيات، و مـن ثـم صـارت غايـة التمـدن أن ينـال الفـرد أقصـى مـا يمكـن مـن
    الاسـتقلال و الحريـة.
    ذلــك لأن الإنســان ترقــى فــي فكــره، فهــو يــرى أن تســليم نفســه إلــى تصــرف
    الحاكــم أمــر لا تســلم بــه لمنزلتــه مــن الإنســانية، و لا يتفــق مــع راحتــه و سـعادته؛
    و لهـذا فهـو لا يقبـل أن يتنـازل لأحـد عـن حريتـه. و لا أن يأتمـن أحـًدا عليهـا و لـو كان
    أقـرب النـاس إليـه، و لا يسـمح بـأن يتـرك منهـا إلـى الحكومــة إلا بقــدر مــا يلــزم تركــه؛
    لتتمكــن مــن تأديــة وظيفتهــا، و هــي المحافظــة علــى الأمــن العــام فــي الداخــل، و
    المدافعــة عــن ســياج الأمــة فــي الخــارج، و أيضــا القيــام بالأعمــال التــي تعــود
    منفعتهــا علــى الجميــع.
    بحسـب هـذا الشـرط يخضـع الفـرد إلـى مـا تقـرره عليـه مـن الأعمـال و الأمـوال، أمـا إذا
    ي فـرد مـن النـاس أن يدخـل فـي عمـل مـن أعمالـه أو شـأن مـن
    ّ
    أرادت الحكومـة أو أ
    شـئونه الخاصـة، فإنـه يشـعر بثقـل الضغـط عليـه، ويجـد فـي نفسـه ألـم الظلـم.
    و لذلك سببان:
    الأول: أن رأي الحاكـم أن طابـق هـوى شـخص، فقـد يخالـف أهـواء الأغلـب؛ لأن الأمزجـة
    مختلفـة، و الغرائـز متباينـة، و الأذواق متفاوتـة على حسب الأشـخاص و الأعمـار و الأزمـان
    و الأمكنـة.

                    EDUCATION - The heart is on
                    Besides information, most schools also focus too much on providing pupils with a
                    set of predetermined skills such as solving differential equations, writing
                    computer code in C++, identifying chemicals in a test tube, or conversing in
                    Chinese. Yet since we have no idea how the world and the job market will look
                    in 2050, we don’t really know what particular skills people will need. We might
                    invest a lot of effort teaching kids how to write in C++ or how to speak Chinese,
                    only to discover that by 2050 AI can code software far better than humans, and
                    a new Google Translate app enables you to conduct a conversation in almost
                    flawless Mandarin, Cantonese or Hakka, even though you only know how to say
                    ‘Ni hao.’
                    So what should we be teaching? Many pedagogical experts argue that schools
                    should switch to teaching ‘the four Cs’ – critical thinking, communication,
                    collaboration and creativity.3 More broadly, schools should downplay technical
                    skills and emphasise general-purpose life skills. Most important of all will be the
                    ability to deal with change, to learn new things, and to preserve your mental
                    balance in unfamiliar situations. In order to keep up with the world of 2050, you
                    will need not merely to invent new ideas and products – you will above all need
                    to reinvent yourself again and again.
                    For as the pace of change increases, not just the economy, but the very meaning
                    of ‘being human’ is likely to mutate. Already in 1848 the Communist Manifesto
                    declared that ‘all that is solid melts into air’. Marx and Engels, however, were
                    thinking mainly about social and economic structures. By 2048, physical and
                    cognitive structures will also melt into air, or into a cloud of data bits.
                    In 1848 millions of people were losing their jobs on village farms, and were going
                    to the big cities to work in factories. But upon reaching the big city, they were
                    unlikely to change their gender or to add a sixth sense. And if they found a job
                    in some textile factory, they could expect to remain in that profession for the
                    rest of their working lives.
                    By 2048, people might have to cope with migrations to cyberspace, with fluid
                    gender identities, and with new sensory experiences generated by computer
                    implants. If they find both work and meaning in designing up-to-the-minute
                    fashions for a 3-D virtual reality game, within a decade not just this particular profession, but all jobs demanding this level of artistic creation might be taken
                    over by AI.
            
                    So at twenty-five you introduce yourself on a dating site as ‘a twenty-five-year-
                    old heterosexual woman who lives in London and works in a fashion shop’. At
            
                    thirty-five you say you are ‘a gender-non-specific person undergoing age-
                    adjustment, whose neocortical activity takes place mainly in the NewCosmos
            
                    virtual world, and whose life mission is to go where no fashion designer has gone
                    before’. At forty-five both dating and selfdefinitions are so passé. You just wait
                    for an algorithm to find (or create) the perfect match for you. As for drawing
                    meaning from the art of fashion design, you are so irrevocably outclassed by the
                    algorithms, that looking at your crowning achievements from the previous
                    decade fills you with embarrassment rather than pride. And at forty-five you still
                    have many decades of radical change ahead of you.
                    Please don’t take this scenario literally. Nobody can really predict the specific
                    changes we will witness. Any particular scenario is likely to be far from the truth.
                    If somebody describes to you the world of the mid twentyfirst century and it
                    sounds like science fiction, it is probably false. But then if somebody describes
                    to you the world of the mid twenty-first century and it doesn’t sound like science
                    fiction – it is certainly false. We cannot be sure of the specifics, but change
                    itself is the only certainty.
                    Such profound change may well transform the basic structure of life, making
                    discontinuity its most salient feature. From time immemorial life was divided into
                    two complementary parts: a period of learning followed by a period of working.
                    In the first part of life you accumulated information, developed skills,
                    constructed a world view, and built a stable identity. Even if at fifteen you spent
                    most of your day working in the family’s rice field (rather than in a formal
                    school), the most important thing you were doing was learning: how to cultivate
                    rice, how to conduct negotiations with the greedy rice merchants from the big
                    city, and how to resolve conflicts over land and water with the other villagers. In
                    the second part of life you relied on your accumulated skills to navigate the
                    world, earn a living, and contribute to society. Of course even at fifty you
                    continued to learn new things about rice, about merchants, and about conflicts,
                    but these were just small tweaks to well-honed abilities.rofession, but all jobs demanding this level of artistic creation might be taken

                    but these were just small tweaks to well-honed abilities.
                    By the middle of the twenty-first century, accelerating change plus longer
                    lifespans will make this traditional model obsolete. Life will come apart at the
                    seams, and there will be less and less continuity between different periods of
                    life. ‘Who am I?’ will be a more urgent and complicated question than ever
                    before.4 This is likely to involve immense levels of stress. For change is almost
                    always stressful, and after a certain age most people just don’t like to change.
                    When you are fifteen, your entire life is change. Your body is growing, your mind
                    is developing, your relationships are deepening. Everything is in flux, and
                    everything is new. You are busy inventing yourself. Most teenagers find it
                    frightening, but at the same time, it is also exciting. New vistas are opening
                    before you, and you have an entire world to conquer.
                    By the time you are fifty, you don’t want change, and most people have given up
                    on conquering the world. Been there, done that, got the T-shirt. You much prefer
                    stability. You have invested so much in your skills, your career, your identity and
                    your world view that you don’t want to start all over again. The harder you’ve
                    worked on building something, the more difficult it is to let go of it and make
                    room for something new. You might still cherish new experiences and minor
                    adjustments, but most people in their fifties aren’t ready to overhaul the deep
                    structures of their identity and personality.
                    There are neurological reasons for this. Though the adult brain is more flexible
                    and volatile than was once thought, it is still less malleable than the teenage
                    brain. Reconnecting neurons and rewiring synapses is damned hard work.5 But in
                    the twenty-first century, you can hardly afford stability. If you try to hold on to
                    some stable identity, job or world view, you risk being left behind as the world
                    flies by you with a whooooosh. Given that life expectancy is likely to increase,
                    you might subsequently have to spend many decades as a clueless fossil. To stay
                    relevant – not just economically, but above all socially – you will need the ability
                    to constantly learn and to reinvent yourself, certainly at a young age like fifty.
                    As strangeness becomes the new normal, your past experiences, as well as the
                    past experiences of the whole of humanity, will become less reliable guides.
                    Humans as individuals and humankind as a whole will increasingly have to deal
                    with things nobody ever encountered before, such as super-intelligent machines,
                    engineered bodies, algorithms that can manipulate your emotions with uncanny
                    precision, rapid man-made climate cataclysms, and the need to change your
                    profession every decade. What is the right thing to do when confronting a
                    completely unprecedented situation? How should you act when you are flooded
                    by enormous amounts of information and there is absolutely no way you can
                    absorb and analyse it all? How to live in a world where profound uncertainty is
                    not a bug, but a feature?
                    To survive and flourish in such a world, you will need a lot of mental flexibility
                    and great reserves of emotional balance. You will have to repeatedly let go of
                    some of what you know best, and feel at home with the unknown.
                    Unfortunately, teaching kids to embrace the unknown and to keep their mental
                    balance is far more difficult than teaching them an equation in physics or the
                    causes of the First World War. You cannot learn resilience by reading a book or
                    listening to a lecture. The teachers themselves usually lack the mental flexibility
                    that the twenty-first century demands, for they themselves are the product of
                    the old educational system.
                    The Industrial Revolution has bequeathed us the production-line theory of
                    education. In the middle of town there is a large concrete building divided into
                    many identical rooms, each room equipped with rows of desks and chairs. At the
                    sound of a bell, you go to one of these rooms together with thirty other kids who
                    were all born the same year as you. Every hour some grown-up walks in, and
                    starts talking. They are all paid to do so by the government. One of them tells
                    you about the shape of the earth, another tells you about the human past, and a
                    third tells you about the human body. It is easy to laugh at this model, and
                    almost everybody agrees that no matter its past achievements, it is now
                    bankrupt. But so far we haven’t created a viable alternative. Certainly not a
                    scaleable alternative that can be implemented in rural Mexico rather than just in
                    upmarket California suburbs.
