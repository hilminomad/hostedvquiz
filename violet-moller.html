        IN EARLY 1509, the young artist Raffaello Sanzio (1483–1520) began painting a
        series of frescoes on the walls of Pope Julius II’s private library, deep inside the
        Vatican. Next door, in the Sistine Chapel, Raphael’s great rival, Michelangelo,
        lay on his back on a huge scaffold, hundreds of feet in the air, painting onto the
        ceiling a monumental image of God giving life to Adam. The Renaissance was in
        full swing in Rome and, under the patronage of Pope Julius, the great city was
        being returned to the glory of its ancient imperial past. Raphael’s frescoes on
        the four walls of the Stanza della Segnatura illustrated the four categories of
        books that were shelved below them: theology, philosophy, law and poetry. In
        the philosophy fresco, which we now call The School of Athens, Raphael painted
        three huge vaulted arches receding into the distance, with statues of the Roman
        gods Minerva and Apollo on either side and broad marble steps leading down to
        a geometrically tiled floor. The architecture is decidedly Roman – bold,
        imperious, monumental – but the culture and ideas represented by the fifty-eight
        figures carefully grouped across the painting are emphatically and almost
        without exception Greek; it is a celebration of the rediscovery of ancient ideas
        that were central to the intellectual milieu of sixteenth-century Rome.
        Plato and Aristotle stand in the very centre, under a huge arch, silhouetted
        against the blue sky, which Plato points up to, while Aristotle gestures to the
        earth below him, neatly representing their philosophical tendencies – the
        former’s preoccupation with the ideal and the heavenly, the latter’s
        determination to understand the physical world around him. The full scope of
        ancient philosophy as inherited by Italian humanism is triumphantly rendered in
        glowing colour.
        No one knows exactly who all the other figures in the fresco are, and arguments
        over their identities have kept scholars occupied for centuries. Most people
        agree that the bald man in the front right, busy demonstrating geometrical
        theory with a compass, is Euclid, while the crowned man next to him, holding a
        globe, is certainly Ptolemy, who at this point was far more famous for his work
        on geography than astronomy. All the figures identified lived in the ancient
        world, at least a thousand years before Raphael began painting the fresco –
        except for one. On the left of the painting, a man wearing a turban is leaning
        over Pythagoras’ shoulder to see what he is writing. He is the Muslim philosopher
        Averroes (1126–1198) – the single identifiable representative of the thousand years
        between the last of the ancient Greek philosophers and Raphael’s own time,
        and the single representative of the vital, vibrant tradition of Arab scholarship
        that had flourished in this period.
        These scholars, who were of various faiths and origins, but were united by the
        fact that they wrote in Arabic, had kept the flame of Greek science burning,
        combining it with other traditions and transforming it with their own hard work
        and brilliance – ensuring its survival and transmission down through the centuries
        to the Renaissance.
        I studied Classics and history throughout my time at school and university, but at
        no point was I taught about the influence of the medieval Arab world, or indeed
        any other external civilization, on European culture. The narrative for the history
        of science seemed to say, ‘There were the Greeks, and then the Romans, and
        then there was the Renaissance,’ glibly skipping over the millennium in between.
        I knew from my medieval-history courses that there wasn’t much scientific
        knowledge in Western Europe in this period, and I began to wonder what had
        happened to the books on mathematics, astronomy and medicine from the
        ancient world. How did they survive? Who recopied and translated them? Where
        were the safe havens that ensured their preservation?
