                    IS IT POSSIBLE TO TEACH ATTITUDES?
                    The notion that an organization could teach anything at all is a relatively new
                    one.
                    Traditionally, society assumed that artists, signers, artisans, writers, scientists,
                    and alchemists would find their calling, then find a mentor, and then learn their
                    craft. It was absurd to think that you’d take people off the street and teach
                    them to do science or to sing, and persist at that teaching long enough for them
                    to get excited about it.
                    Now that we’ve built an industrial solution to teaching in bulk, we’ve seduced
                    ourselves into believing that the only thing that can be taught is the way to get
                    high SAT scores.
                    We shouldn’t be buying this.
                    We can teach people to make commitments, to overcome fear, to deal
                    transparently, to initiate, and to plan a course.
                    We can teach people to desire lifelong learning, to express themselves, and to
                    innovate.
                    And just as important, it’s vital we acknowledge that we can unteach bravery
                    and creativity and initiative. and that we have been doing just that.
                    In order to efficiently jam as much testable data into a generation of kids, we
                    push to make those children complient, competitive zombies.
                    School has become an industrialized system, working on a huge scale, that has
                    significant byproducts, including the destruction of many of the attitudes and
                    emotions we’d like to build our culture around.
